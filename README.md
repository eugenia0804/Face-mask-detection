# Face-mask-detection
Due to the impact of the COVID-19, the need of image recognition for the mask are grow- ing rapidly. Undoubtedly, using machines to check the wearing of mask can greatly save the labor cost. Through the experiment, it had been found out that having 4 layers is an rational choice. After comparing different existing models and their performance on this specific task, the neural network ”DenseNet” was discovered to has the best accuracy and lowest loss. After that, the research specified on to the ”DenseNet” network, by changing its learning rate and activation function, the model has successfully reach the accuracy of 99.5%, performing the image classification work just as intended.
